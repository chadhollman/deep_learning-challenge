Predicting Alphabet Soup's Successful Applicants

Overview:
The purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model with neural networks to predict which applicants are likely to be successful in their ventures when provided funding

Results:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
IS_SUCCESSFUL
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
All other columns that provide application information
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
EIN and NAME were removed

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
(see DropoutLayer image file) I used 2 hidden layers, one with 128 neurons, and one with 64
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? I wasn't despite the adjustments
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
(see OptimizerUpdate image file) I updated the optimizer in hopes of improvement and reduced the epoch count as well

Overall, I couldn't find a way to improve the model's accuracy from the original model. The closest accuracy I could manage was just under 73%
